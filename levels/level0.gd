The world went to chaos three weeks ago.
Nobody belived it at first, but it was true. Zombies,
like in the movies, were roaming free.

I've been hidden at home from the start, but Iḿ'm out
of food. I need to think about leaving...
What! What is that sound! Oh, no! They have managed
to break the door! The zombies are here!

It's Zombie Time!
